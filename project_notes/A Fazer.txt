THINGS TO DO:
	- Add a Search Bar to the Cronometer Panel.
		- Customize the Style for the Search Bar.
		- Allow it to filter the Cronometers.
			- Modify the Cronometer Panel View so it only displays the Searched Cronometers.
		*- Figure out why the the Cronometer List isn't sorted when started up. It might be related to the fact that the list doesn't account for the new Cronometer when a new one is added.
		- Find a way to clone the Cronometer List into the Searched Cronometer List when the Search Term is empty.
