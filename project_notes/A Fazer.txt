THINGS TO DO:
	- Make the App record Cronometer Interaction Histories.
		- Test if these processes are working properly.
		- Force the Command Name display of the Command History Widget to occupy, at most, half of the screen's width.
			*- Figure out what's causing the overflow in all Command History widgets.
	- Make the App record Time Record Editing Histories.
		- Change the updateInfoType for these Commands to Map, so the Date where they were applied is also recorded.
	- Refactor the App's Theme. Start back from the Main Theme class and remove all others.
