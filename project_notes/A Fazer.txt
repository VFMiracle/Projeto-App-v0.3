THINGS TO DO:
	- Fix the visual and styling errors throughout the App. They seem to be caused by a new visual configuration for Flutter called Material3.
		- Fix the overflow in the Cronometer View's Bottom App Bar.
			- Stop using the BottomAppBar component, since it has a fixed height now. Either use a different component in the bottomNavigationBar of a Scaffold, or move the Buttons to a new wrapper component on the Scaffold's body.
		- Fix the weird Color Scheme in the Time Editor Theme. Most prominently seen in the Time Record Panel's Time Record Creator.
			- Figure out how to make the child of a Theme Widget use it's parent's overwrites.
		- Fix the Date Picker Dialog's visual issues.
			*- Fix the overflow on it's description of the Selected Date.
