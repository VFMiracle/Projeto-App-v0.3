THINGS TO DO:
	- Build the process for reading Command Histories from the Database.
		- Determine how the Command History DTO will be structured.
		- Modify the testing function of CommandHistoryDAO so it returns a List of Command History DTOs.
			- Create a function in the Command History DAO that converts the Database maps into Command History DTOs.
			- Create a function in the Command History DAO that converts the Database entry's update info from a String into it's specific type.
			*- Figure out why the function that reads Database items is throwing an error. It might be because the argumentes parameter doesn't do what was assumed it did.
