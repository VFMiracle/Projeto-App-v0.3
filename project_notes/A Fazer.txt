THINGS TO DO:
	*- Check if the App is still loading other Command History Types properly.
	- Make the App record Time Record Editing Histories.
		- Clear the Database of all Command History Records.
		- Update the _convertUpdateInfoStringToMap function of the Command History Panel Facade so it works with other Key Value Pair types beyond String/int.
		- Change the updateInfoType for these Commands to Map, so the Date where they were applied is also recorded.
	- Refactor the App's Theme. Start back from the Main Theme class and remove all others.
