THINGS TO DO:
	- Fix some small things on the App
		*- Stop using the TimeZone package. The App uses the time from the Device itself, so any weird DateTime recordings come from the Device's own hour value.
		- Change the message on the Command History Panel for when there are no Command Histories to show.
	- Make the App record Cronometer Editing Histories.
		- Test if the recording process for these Commands are working properly.
	- Make the App record Cronometer Interaction Histories.
	- Make the App record Time Record Editing Histories.
		- Change the updateInfoType for these Commands to Map, so the Date where they were applied is also recorded.
