THINGS TO DO:
	*- Consider changing the fromIntToString fucntion of the TimeConversionService so it doesn't use the DateTime class, as it brings a lot of data that the function doesn't use.
	- Create a system for maintaining a history of the changes to the Time Records.
		- Determine how it'll be structured.
		- Build the Model and View for the Command History Widget (it represents an entry in the Command History Panel).
			- Write a test class that implements the CommandHistoryModel.
				- Check if the test class doesn't require any extra functionality.
			- Use the test class to check how the Command History Panel will look like.
			- Fix the visual issues with the Command History Panel and it's Histories.
				*- Add some formatting to the Creation Date of a Command History.
		- Build the Command Hisotry Panel Model.
